    # this mapper is used so that new and old versions of the service can be run simultaneously,
    # making rolling upgrades easier
    # This is used by SQLAlchemy to explicitly define which fields we're interested
    # so it doesn't freak out and say it can't map the structure if other fields are present.
    # This could occur from a failed deploy or during an upgrade.
    # The other option is to tell SQLAlchemy to ignore differences, but that is ambiguous
    # and can interfere with Alembic upgrades.

    # NOTE: please keep mapper names in alpha-order, easier to track that way
