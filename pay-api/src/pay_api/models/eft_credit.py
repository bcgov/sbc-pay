    # making rolling upgrades easier

    # so it doesn't freak out and say it can't map the structure if other fields are present.
    # This could occur from a failed deploy or during an upgrade.
    # The other option is to tell SQLAlchemy to ignore differences, but that is ambiguous
    # and can interfere with Alembic upgrades.
